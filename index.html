        <p> Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braddon,_Australian_Capital_Territory">Braddon</a>, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.</p>
