                <!-- The content is seperated into paragraphs with open and closing paragaraph brackets -->

                <p>Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.</p>

                <p>Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.</p>

                <p>Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia.

                <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:
                </p>
                <!-- This is an unordered list -->
                <ul>
                    <li> - Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                    <li>- Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings. </li>
                </ul>
                <!-- The content is seperated into paragraphs with open and closing paragaraph brackets -->

                <p>
                    In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use.
                </p>

                <p> The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles. </p>

                <p> Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.
